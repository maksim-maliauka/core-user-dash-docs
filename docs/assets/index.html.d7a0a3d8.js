First and last - are automatically generated sections, next statements are valid for them:</p><ul><li>Workflow always starts from <strong>Start Section</strong></li><li>Each workflow branch (current workflow has only one branch) must be ended with <strong>Finish Section</strong></li></ul><p>Second one is a trigger section or just <strong>Trigger</strong> - this type of sections usually begins the workflow, we can say that &quot;Any workflow starts its execution form Trigger&quot;. The Workflow can have multiple triggers at the beginning, which means that list of the actions which laying under triggers can be executed multiple times depending on trigger event:</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="Simple Workflow"></p><p>Third section is an action section or just <strong>Action</strong>. Actions can do some work for your leads, for example &quot;Send an Email&quot; or &quot;Change Lead Status&quot; and many other things. Usually Actions on the Workflows stands vertically when Triggers mostly horizontally.</p><p>We&#39;ve just seen 4 main section types:</p><ul><li>Start</li><li>Finish</li><li>Trigger</li><li>Action</li></ul><p>Check the full list of sections and their types: <a href="/workflows/sections">Workflow sections</a></p>',12);function u(t,f){return s(),i("div",null,[e("h1",d,[p,n(" "+a(t.$page.title),1)]),g])}const m=o(h,[["render",u],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
