First and last - are automatically generated sections, next statements are valid for them:</p><ul><li>Workflow always starts from <strong>Start Section</strong></li><li>Each workflow branch (current workflow has only one branch) must be ended with <strong>Finish Section</strong></li></ul><p>Second one is a trigger section or just <strong>Trigger</strong> - this type of sections usually begins the workflow, we can say that &quot;Any workflow starts its execution form Trigger&quot;. The Workflow can have multiple triggers at the beginning, which means that list of the actions which laying under triggers can be executed multiple times depending on trigger event:</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Simple Workflow"></p><p>Third section is an action section or just <strong>Action</strong>. Actions can do some work for your leads, for example &quot;Send an Email&quot; or &quot;Change Lead Status&quot; and many other things.
